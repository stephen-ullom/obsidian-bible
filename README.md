# Bible Callout

Effortlessly insert Bible verses in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Usage

To use the Bible Callout, insert the following [code block](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Code+blocks) in the Obsidian file:

```NASB
Romans 10:9-10

Move the cursor outside the code block, and it will display the callout:
